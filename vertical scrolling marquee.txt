<P><I><BR>Dear Mr. Wise,<BR>I have been using The Wise Agent system since 2002 for managing my real estate business. I just wanted to let you &amp; your awesome staff know that The Wise Agent was able to help me control all of my time sensitive issues, keep track of all escrows, and even remember my calls, anniversaries &amp; birthdays. I personally feel that my business doubled the first year using The Wise Agent, &amp; will quadruple over the next two years. In short, Mr. Wise, The Wise Agent will not allow me to make mistakes if I properly control the transaction. I just wanted to give you this personal compliment that I feel is necessary at this time in my career. This is the best time management and contact management system I've ever used! <BR>If you should ever need a testimony about your system, fliers, newsletters and all other functions that help me excel in my business, please call me personally at-.<BR>Professionally yours,<BR>Bill K.</I></P>
<P><I><BR>Hi Grady and Bryan!<BR>Thank you both so much for all that you do to aid realtors in promoting our careers. Thank you, also, for sponsoring various programs and events. Security Title is definitely the best title company in the area! I am so happy to know that I am working with true professionals who really keep the clients' best interests in mind. Thank you for your help! <BR>Pauline S.</I></P>
<P><I><BR>I love this program, great work!<BR>Thanks,<BR>Erik </I></P>
<P><I><BR>Just a note to let you know that I get so many compliments almost on a daily basis about the Wise Agent tool! Debie in my office was totally impressed when you called her back and took care of her problem so rapidly - some sort of "font" issue.<BR>Your the Best in the Pines of Northern Arizona!<BR>You guys are truly amazingly helpful!<BR>Linda </I></P>
<P><I><BR>I love the program and just entered all of my previous clients. This is a very easy contact management system!<BR>Thank you,<BR>Marilyn D.</I></P>

<P><I><BR>Eric,<BR>I just wanted to thank you for taking the time to do training with Marilyn.<BR>It was SO last minute and I really appreciate you taking the time. We only recently opened that office and they are getting a ton of listings. The agents had no system going<BR>and we were afraid that they would get so behind that they would have trouble getting organized!<BR>So again?really appreciate!<BR>Have a great weekend!<BR>Susan B.</I></P>

<P><I><BR>You all are so great I bet you can fix my "problem" with no effort at all!!<BR>Heidi C.</I></P>
<P><I><BR>Good morning--I've been on Wise Agent now for a few months and love the program. I am interested in getting setup direct so that I can share this program with others. <BR>Thanks, Harold H.</I></P>
<P><I><BR>Dear Heidi, Just wanted to let you know I opened a $2,085,000 escrow with Security Title in appreciation for the use of Wise Agent. I know I am not using it to its fullness yet but I am experimenting each day. <BR>Thanks again for this opportunity. <BR>Bev E.</I></P>
<P><I><BR>My name is Mike F. I live in Prescott Valley, AZ., and enjoy using the Wise Agent format that helps me communicate with my customer's and prospect's very professionally. Thank you,<BR>Mike F.</I></P>
<P><I><BR>Dear Wise Agent:<BR>Just a brief comment to tell you how much I appreciate your service. I began using it shortly after I joined Keller Williams, and have been extremely impressed with it. I hope it goes on forever....<BR>There are other services available, but I think they are more complex, harder to use, and much more expensive. <BR>Are you planning any more training seminars at KW Sonoran Living? I'd like to meet you folks again!<BR>Tom K.</I></P>
<P><I><BR>Thank you!!<BR>I Love the new to do list. And it looks like the check lists have some good changes too.<BR>Lori C.</I></P>
<P><I><BR>Thanks for the excellent job and the precious help. You make our work so much easier!<BR>Have an extraordinary year 2007!<BR>Isabela H.</I></P>

<P><I><BR>Thank you and please feel free to use me as a reference if you need.<BR>Andrew Monaghan, The Monaghan Group Keller Williams Realty</I></P>
<P><I><BR>Thanks for your help with Barbara's account. We both really appreciate it. I've been telling her for months how great you guys are and how awesome the Wise Agent system is and the best part in my opinion is the tech support. I usually interact with Amy, and she the absolute best! Anyway thanks! Pamela G., Keller Williams Agent and one of your number one fans. Hey if anyone from the Wise Agent team is in the Prescott area, Barbara and I are in our new office in Prescott Valley, drop in and see us and we'll buy lunch. Oh and we have a third member of our group joining us soon so we'll have to get him on board with you too! <BR>Best Regards, <BR>Pamela G.</I></P>
<P><I><BR>Me again,<BR>Thanks for calling me sooooo fast.<BR>Garry D.</I></P>
<P><I><BR>Hi guys,<BR>Just wanted to thank you guys for your excellent service. I have found the wise agent to be progressively helpful in building my real estate business. The contacting software has made it easy to keep in touch with my clients and appear on top of everything they need. It is a very powerful tool and helps me to stand out in a crowd of many agents today who do not follow up well. Your responsiveness to my inquiries are also great. I am using more and more of the site every day. If I think of anything to help us both improve, I will continue to let you know. Thanks again,<BR>Thomas G.</I></P>
<P><I><BR>Thank you and am looking forward to being able to get text message of appt's and emails. What a great reminder service. Hope it will keep me out the loop of forgetfulness.<BR>Dave P</I></P>
<P><I><BR>You definitely have the fastest customer service in the West, East, North and South. Yeah! I figured out that much.<BR>Thanks,<BR>Randall</I></P>
<P><I><BR>Thank you! I have to say, that so far in my two or so weeks of using your program, I am very pleased. I have sent numerous e-mails and you always respond promptly and fix / correct / advise whatever my question happens to be. Thank you for the service. I took an online class today with Heidi and found it to be very helpful.<BR>I will be back tomorrow for the advanced class.<BR>Enjoy your afternoon!<BR>Bob M.</I></P>
<P><I><BR>Thanks very much for your help; you are part of the BEST support group I have ever met. You are always ready to help, days, nights, and even the weekends, and I very much appreciate it.<BR>Garry D.</I></P>
<P><I><BR>Hey! This is great software! I love it!<BR>Clifford C.</I></P>
<P><I><BR>WOW! Thanks! Now that?s what I call great support! You have a good night! And thanks again!<BR>Isaura N.</I></P>
<P><I><BR>What! Are you trying to be a God Send? Thank you for your servant?s heart. You folks are a blessing to my bride and myself and we haven't even begun to work with you yet (though we decided to sign up at "hello")...<BR>In His Service,<BR>Dave P.</I></P>
<P><I><BR>Thank you very much! Everything looks GREAT! No offense but I hope I don't need your services in the future, hehe. BUT I was very pleased with your prompt responses to my concerns. Who on your team should I write to that will allow me to commend your efforts in customer service in relation to my issues? WOW that was wordy! LOL. I guess what I am saying is I want to write a letter to your supervisor complementing you on your wonderful customer service skills. Who do I send it to?<BR>Jason R.</I></P>
<P><I><BR>Hi,<BR>Sent out my first WiseAgent Newsletter and this is a response I got. Yeah! and Thank you, Nancy.<BR>Hi Nancy, Got the newsletter yesterday - I liked it, what a nice change from the postcards. Is this a permanent change? Thanks for the corned beef dinner recipe. JoAnn</I></P>
<P><I><BR>I love this program and love how fast you all get back to me. Thanks for everything!<BR>Robyn</I></P>
<P><I><BR>Thanks for all your help! You always fix my problems!<BR>Jennifer R.</I></P>
<P><I><BR>Hey Ya'll, Great class this morning with Heidi Hoot. She did a wonderful job and was patiently answering every question and took loads of time with us as a class and group. "10.0"!<BR>She made note the there may be a marketing class just for the market plan (tab). Do we have a schedule for that one soon??<BR>Ya'll are the best and we are sold. Even going out and buying phones that will sync directly with this product. Wish us well in that search. Got a phone referral on that shoppers tab?<BR>Dave P<BR>PS- Are you trying to make us out to be loyal consumers?...<BR>Well it's working :o}</I></P>
<P><I><BR>I just sent out my first email flyer and it was AWESOME! Thank you,<BR>Nancy</I></P>
<P><I><BR>Thank you so much Heather, you are wonderful, you really don't know how much time you have just saved me. I am looking forward to my business picking up again and being able to use Wise agent to my advantage.<BR>Sincerely,<BR>Shelley N</I></P>
<P><I><BR>I love this system and would be lost without it.<BR>Thanks for your help,<BR>Terry P.</I></P>
<P><I><BR>Just wanted to thank you guys, particularly Eric in IT, for the help with Intellisync. You're great. <BR>Ray J</I></P>
<P><I><BR>I would like to say I really enjoy your software and wanted to be able to utilize all applications to make my business grow.<BR>Joyce B.</I></P>
<P><I><BR>I love this program and would like to continue to use it. <BR>Thanks,<BR>Nancy D.</I></P>
<P><I><BR>Thank you everyone at Wise Agent......I got it!!!! You've all been most helpful.....just also giving you a head's up......you'll probably be getting a lot of emails from me with questions......Jo<BR>Great response times last night. THANKS.<BR>Bill K.</I></P>
<P><I><BR>Thanks for having such a good product.<BR>Steve B.</I></P>
<P><I><BR>You guys are great! Thanks for your assistance.<BR>Rick S.</I></P>
<P><I><BR>Brandon,<BR>I just want to pass along Marilyn's and my personal thanks to you and your Wise Agent team for the fantastic and very timely "matrix" fix to our checklist issue. It works great, addresses the problem and provides us the ability to select properties. Wise Agent's response to our problem was out of this world so naming the fix button "Matrix" was a good choice. Your team also followed up quickly on Brenda's suggestion to sort the properties in alphabetical order for quick visual search. Being a Wise Agent customer is something special and we want you to know we feel it and recognize the efforts of the entire Wise Agent team. Well done!<BR>Sincerely,<BR>Steve K.</I></P>
<P><I><BR>By the way, you guys are moving at warp speed in your response time and making requested changes! I'm very impressed!<BR>Anita K.</I></P>
<P><I><BR>Hi Heather,<BR>Very efficient! You remind me a the children's book, Shoemaker's Helpers!! (:) They worked while the shoemaker was asleep.<BR>I love your program for realtors.<BR>Thanks,<BR>Donna V.</I></P>
<P><I><BR>I appreciate all you do for us!<BR>Sue R.</I></P>
<P><I><BR>I have no problem paying for the service, I think it's great.<BR>Thanks,<BR>Mike G.</I></P>
<P><I><BR>Hello Heidi,<BR>The agents were very interested in signing up for the program after the class as a direct result of your efforts focusing on what is important to them. I signed up two of them on the spot and they informed me they would be opening two escrows with us next week. The remaining agents gave me their business cards and asked me to call them and set up a one-on-one appointment. After the hour class the agents were not overwhelmed with the information and provided specific feedback that confirmed they had a very good understanding of the progarm. <BR>Thanks again for a great class!<BR>Michelle </I></P>
<P><I><BR>Hi Deb,<BR>Thanks for your help. I'm on the site and in my client database. I love the site and service.<BR>Thanks!<BR>Mike G.</I></P>
<P><I><BR>Thanks to all of you for all your help! Brandon was right about your customer service! Have a great day!<BR>Brian Q.</I></P>
<P><I><BR>I will be suspending my real estate license (not renewing it) but would continue using my wiseagent data base, as I love your program and how simple it is to use.<BR>Many thanks,<BR>Michelle W.</I></P>
<P><I><BR>Hi Heidi,<BR>I was in a class on Monday and brought up Wise Agent to others in the class. Anytime someone mentions "Database?, I always mention you guys, great product and your customer service has such a "refreshing? high standard mentality which sets you guys apart. Keep up the great work, Brandon has "wisely" chosen to run his business with people that not only know what they're doing, but also really care.<BR>BTW, I love your last name............you can literally say "I'm a Hoot" and mean it! :):):)<BR>You guys rock!<BR>Cathy K.</I></P>
<P><I><BR>(Compliment on Newsflash)<BR>Love that you are sending these types of emails out to keep users up to date on the changes you make. Keep up the great job!<BR>Now, I will add the zinger--hoping for "email capabilities" one day soon. :)<BR>Warm regards,<BR>Vicki K.</I></P>
<P><I><BR>We thank you, Wise Agent for your prompt services and wonderful site that is very user friendly. We sincerely appreciate your customer support and constant improvement to your site to accommodate your members.<BR>Kathleen B &amp; DJ</I></P>
<P><I><BR>I just want you guys to know that I have tried most real estate tools available today and nothing has ever impressed me like The Wise Agent! I love your real estate flyers and letters. The CRM system is the most powerful I have ever come across and I look at them all. GREAT JOB!<BR>Mike M.</I></P>
<P><I><BR>I have spent a few months comparing real estate tools, transaction management systems, and real estate contact management systems and have to hand it to you, Wise Agent is the best! Your customer service is over the top and the user friendly format your system in makes you number 1.<BR>Lisa P. </I></P>
<P><I><BR>Dear The Wise Agent: <BR>Just wanted to mention how much I appreciate the fantastic support you have provided me over the past few months and, how much I've enjoyed using The Wise Agent. I especially like the Seller Checklist and Buyer Checklist and calendar features. These are great tools for transaction management and reduce my stress! And thanks for the continual updates and additions! Wow-I sure feel like I'm getting my money's worth! <BR>Sincerely, Liz </I></P>
<P><I><BR>Thanks for all you do. <BR>It is a pleasure to be associated with your program. <BR>Lin B. </I></P>
<P><I><BR>Hi, I just wanted to say how impressed I was at your presentation at the seminar. <BR>We would love for you to come up north and present this wonderful product to our office and possibly the Sedona Verde Valley MLS. <BR>Thanks again, <BR>Ila G. </I></P>
<P><I><BR>Hello Wise Agent.... <BR>We have been using your system for a few weeks now and it has been great. <BR>Thank you. <BR>Curt L. </I></P>
<P><I><BR>Wow!!! <BR>You guys are good...Fast response time!!! <BR>Coann H. </I></P>
<P><I><BR>Hello, Your technical support is the best I have ever experienced. <BR>Congratulations! <BR>Thank you, <BR>Ron B. </I></P>
<P><I><BR>Hi there! <BR>I attended David Compton's Empowerment Conference in Elk Grove, CA this week and was blown away with your program. I have been looking for a low-cost, real estate specific, SW program for my business. Where have you been??? Top Producer is way too expensive and too complicated. I have used DB programs since 1988 and cannot figure out how to use all that "bells &amp; whistles" the Top Producer offers. <BR>Regards, <BR>Deborah L. </I></P>
<P><I><BR>Hello: I love this program. Had to have it when it was demonstrated last week. I haven't really used it to its fullest yet, but I know I will! <BR>I would like to recommend your company to my old brokerage firm and to the company I am currently with. Do you mind? <BR>Thanks, <BR>Margaret B. </I></P>
<P><I><BR>Hi Guys! I enjoyed your presentation last week and am sure I'll enjoy your online program. <BR>Bill L. </I></P>
<P><I><BR>The Wise Agent is WONDERFUL! <BR>MERRY CHRISTMAS! <BR>Tim C. </I></P>
<P><I><BR>Love the program. The stock letters are fantastic. However, how do I print them? Please advise. <BR>Thanks in advance. <BR>Ali B. </I></P>
<P><I><BR>I got a voice mail last Friday from Mona, a Long agent, who just wanted me to know how much she loves The Wise Agent and would be telling all her coworkers the value of the program. Our existing customers are becoming our best advocates. They are encouraging potential TGA customers to come to the presentations. Couldn?t ask for better testimonials. Every class we have new customers attending and have a couple new escrows as a result. Thanks for your support. <BR>Diana C. </I></P>
<P><I><BR>I wanted to let you know that Wise Agent ROCKS! I needed to send an email to a client today and my company's corporate email system is down. I did not want to send my client an email from my personal email account. I logged onto Wise Agent and was able to send my client an email using my corporate email address through your system. Thank you Wise Agent! <BR>Tony S. </I></P>
<P><I><BR>Thank you so much for taking the time to come down and show us your product. It was unbelievable. I think this will be the greatest product we have ever been able offer our clients. <BR>Chris R. </I></P>
<P><I><BR>Thank you. This is a wonderful program and several of my agents have said how much they love it. <BR>Bekki B. </I></P>
<P><I><BR>Thanks to you and your team! We had another great training at award realty today! <BR>Thanks, <BR>Tony S. </I></P>
<P><I><BR>Thanks for the help... Still think you are a great company and good support... <BR>Pamela M. <BR>Thx , you guys have great service already,,this will be a great thing.. <BR>Thx again, <BR>Fred S. </I></P>
<P><I><BR>Thanks for calling me so quickly. You all are awesome! <BR>Marcelle S. </I></P>
<P><I><BR>You guys are awesome!!! And doing a great job....especially your response time is amazing! Tell Brandon I told him to give you all a raise :-) <BR>Thanks a million!!! <BR>Jean </I></P>
<P><I><BR>First of all I want to tell you that I enjoy using wise agent for all of my real estate needs. <BR>Thank you, <BR>Leanne K. </I></P>
<P><I><BR>Finally - I love the program. I developed 2 flyers today with ease and no problems. <BR>Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <BR>Shelly S. </I></P>
<P><I><BR>Boy - are you guys ever on the ball! <BR>Thanks for the fast reply, I do appreciate it! <BR>Beth L. </I></P>
<P><I><BR>This email from one of our customers says it all about the success of The Wise Agent in Tucson. We are getting this kind of feedback from all the participants that attend the seminars. Thank you for giving us a chance to utilize this service in our market. <BR>Diana C. </I></P>
<P><I><BR>Thanks Shelly for sharing this information. We feel it is a great program. <BR>Diana, agents love this program <BR>Bekki B. </I></P>
<P><I><BR>To Whom It May Concern: <BR>Again, I just wanted to thank TGA for introducing me to Wise Agent. Interestingly, I had planned to purchase a database management system and had looked into purchasing Top Producer, but held off because Bekki had raved about this new system. I have to say, after 2 weeks of regular follow up, she finally convinced me to go to the training (rather reluctantly I must admit). But I had committed that this year I would actually incorporate a database management system into my business plan. She even picked me up from home, since I recently had foot surgery and had no other form of transportation at that time. I have been avoiding a database system for 13 years. I?ve bought so many different software programs, tried to them started, and then failed because they all seem user UNFRIENDLY. <BR>I must say -- I love this system. It?s user friendly, has almost all the variables I needed to implement for my marketing plan this year, including capability to develop activity series, flyers, letters, newsletters, tracking CE hours, tracking lockboxes, listing and selling checklists, ability to synchronize my palm to the Wise Agent calendar, easy conversion from excel databases, etc. I?m not saying all the bugs haven?t been worked out, but I have been looking for a system for many, many years ? and this is the 1st one that I can say I actually have taken the time to start using it. And I?m hooked! <BR>My hats off to TGA for the insight to bring this to the Tucson Market ? you?re going to kill your competition and you?ve got my business! <BR>Thanks again, <BR>Shelly S. <BR>Brandon, thanks. Your guys' response time is first class!! <BR>Blair B </I></P>
<P><I><BR>Thank you for fixing the calling list the way it should really function practically. Meaning when I have the call list up, update the notes, and hit exit it take me right back to the call list!!! Awesome guys!!! :-) <BR>Jean N. </I></P>
<P><I><BR>Thank you so very much for everything. I couldn't figure out how to fix my picture and I appreciate that very much. I am blown away by your superior customer service and the wise agent system in whole. <BR>KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!!!!!!!! <BR>Thanks, <BR>Jeremy S </I></P>
<P><I><BR>YOU ROCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WOOO HOOOOO. Everyone here is very excited <BR>About your help...one of us learns something from you and we share the info, I am a pro at adding outlook now. <BR>Charli C. </I></P>

<P><I><BR>Thank you from the bottom of my heart Jenny!! Now I can go and order the cards. <BR>I actually mentioned yesterday to my broker and other agents the exceptional help received from you and your team. The agents that use wise agent they all agreed that you are offering a great product and exceptional customer service!! <BR>We are very grateful! <BR>MARIANA O. </I></P>
<P><I><BR>Greetings from "Preskitt"! <BR>Keep up the good work and thank for raising the bar! A personal thanks to your own customer service gal, Jenny. She took a lot of extra time helping me get the TP date base converted into something I could test on Wise Agent. She was terrific to work with! <BR>Dick G. </I></P>

<P><I><BR>You guys are the best! (The top, in my book!) I have never seen customer service like Wise Agent. During my trial period, I was so impressed. <BR>It seems like in general most businesses have lost sight of customer service. <BR>Thanks again! <BR>Christine E. </I></P>

<P><I><BR>Mike, I just have to say your support is thee best I have ever seen. <BR>I also own F1 Computing Services in Tucson AZ and have been in the PC support and repair for 25 years. I worked for IBM for 15 years as a Software engineer and your people really know the meaning of support. As I get more familiar with The Wise Agent I will definitely give you input on enhancements. I had Top Producer for 2 months and it was clearly an inferior product to Wise Agent. Thanks for the great support. <BR>Frank H. </I></P>
<P><I><BR>You guys are amazing. <BR>Charli C. </I></P>

<P><I>I absolutely love the customer service at The Wise Agent! They are always so quick to respond to all questions! I also live in my database daily and can not imagine life without The Wise Agent at my disposal everywhere I go. I KNOW that The Wise Agent has allowed me to almost double my business!! <BR>Thank you to Brandon, Brian and Heidi for signing me up last year! You guys ROCK!! <BR>-Erik H. in Orlando FL</I></P></MARQUEE></div>
